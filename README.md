Installation:

You may need yo install non core modules with cpan or cpanm.

Usage:

$ perl parse_COVID-19.pl

The program retrieves the daily JSON summary https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/blob/master/dati-json/dpc-covid19-ita-regioni.json and creates in ./out folder an Excel file with one sheet for each region with data stored for each day.

The Excel file (not updated) is this one: https://github.com/robianc/parse_COVID-19/blob/master/out/COVID-19.xlsx

The Excel also incudes the computation, for each day i, of deceased(i) / deceased(j) for j=i-1 ... i-10. This ratio could give an indication on the trend of death counts based on counts j days before.
